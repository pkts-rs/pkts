//! Packet defragmentation and re-ordering via [`Sequence`]s.
//!
//! Some protocols allow for messages to be fragmented into several
//! packets, and others additionally account for re-ordering of packets
//! after they have arrived at an endpoint. The [`Sequence`] type can be
//! used to perform defragmentation and reordering such that messages
//! are returned in the correct sequence and with the proper message
//! boundaries (where applicable).
//!
//! Passing packets through Sequence types ensure that the following
//! three properties are fulfilled if they are part of the given [`Layer`]'s
//! protocol:
//!
//! 1. Packets are rearranged to conform to a particular order (such as
//! sequence numbers for [`Tcp`])
//! 2. Packets that are marked as fragmented are reassembled
//! 3. Message bounds are maintained where appropriate (for example,
//! [`Sctp`] data chunks are returned on a chunk-by-chunk basis instead
//! of being combined into one continuous stream like TCP does).
//!
//! Sequences are relatively straightforward, with simple `put()` and `get()`
//! operations to pass packets into a streamm and retrieve payloads data,
//! respectively:
//!
//! TODO: example here
//!
//! Sequences can optionally have filters added to automatically discard
//! packets based on field values:
//!
//! TODO: example here
//!
//! When parsing raw data flows, it is often useful to perform defragmentation
//! and reordering operations on a chain of multiple layers, such as handling
//! IPv4 fragmentation _and_ TCP reordering on the same packet. The [`LayeredSequence`]
//! struct allows for multiple Sequence types to be chained sequentially in this
//! manner such that each Sequence acts on the payload contents returned from
//! the Sequence type before it.
//!
//! TODO: example here
//!
//! [`Sctp`]: struct@crate::layers::sctp::Sctp
//! [`Tcp`]: struct@crate::layers::tcp::Tcp

// There are three characteristics that a packet Sequence may exhibit:
// 1. Reordering of packets relative to each other
// 2. Reassembly of fragments of a single packet
// 3. Conveying message bounds

// A Sequence may adhere to any combination of these characteristics. For example:
// - `TcpSequence` reorders packets relative to each other in a TCP stream (1), but does
//   not reassemble packets (since there is no notion of fragmentation in a TCP packet)
//   or convey message bounds (since TCP is a stream-based protocol)
// - `Ipv4Sequence` performs fragmentation reassembly (2), but it does not necessarily
//   deliver packets in order (1) or convey strict message bounds (3).
// - `SctpSequence` exhibits all three of these characteristics--it reorders packets in
//   a given stream, reassembles individual fragmented packets within that stream and
//   upholds Data Chunk boundaries in the data it returns.
