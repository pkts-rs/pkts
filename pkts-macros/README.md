### **pkts-macros - a [pkts](https://crates.io/crates/pkts) submodule for generating common code for Layers**

---

Rscap is a multi-purpose library for network packet capture/transmission and packet building. Its aims are twofold:

1. To provide Rust-native platform tools for packet capture and transmission (comparable to `libpcap`, but written from the ground up in Rust)
2. To expose a robust and ergonomic API for building packets and accessing/modifying packet data fields in various network protocols (like `scapy`, but with strong typing and significantly improved performance)

The `pkts` module focuses solely on (2). It provides a packet-building API for a wide variety of network protocol layers.
This library isn't meant to only cover Datalink through Transport layers or stateless protocols--thanks to `Sequence` and `Session` types (which defragment/reorder packets and track packet state, respectively), any application-layer protocol can be easily captured and decoded.

The `pkts-macros` submodule provides derive macros for `pkts` that assist in creating new `Layer` types.

More information about the library can be found in the [`rscap`](https://crates.io/crates/rscap) or [`pkts`](https://crates.io/crates/pkts) crates, or at [pkts.org](https://pkts.org/).
