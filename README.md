**pkts - ergonomic, `no-std`-compatible packet construction and manipulation**

---

`pkts` is a multi-purpose library for network packet capture/transmission and packet building. Its aims are twofold:

1. To provide Rust-native platform tools for packet capture and transmission (comparable to `libpcap`, but written from the ground up in Rust)
2. To expose a robust and ergonomic API for building packets and accessing/modifying packet data fields in various network protocols (like `scapy`, but with strong typing and significantly improved performance)

`pkts` specifically accomplishes (2), while the sibling [`rscap` library](https://github.com/pkts-rs/rscap) handles (1).

## Features

- **Platform-independent interface for packet capture/transmission:** `rscap` provides a single unified interface for capturing and transmitting packets across any supported platform. Additionally, the library exposes safe abstractions of platform-specific packet capture tools (such as `AF_PACKET`/`PACKET_MMAP` sockets in Linux) to support cases where fine-grained control or platform-specific features are desired.
- **`no-std` Compatible:** every packet type in the `pkts` crate can be used without the standard library, and a special `LayerRef` type can be used to access raw packet bytes without requiring `alloc`.
- **Robust APIs for building/modifying packets:** `pkts` provides simple operations to combine various layers into a single packet, and to index into a different layers of a packet to retrieve or modify fields. Users of [`scapy`](https://github.com/secdev/scapy) may find the API surprisingly familiar, especially for layer composition and indexing operations:

```rust
use layers::{ip::Ipv4, tcp::Tcp};

let pkt = Ip::new() / Tcp::new();
pkt[Tcp].set_sport(80);
pkt[Tcp].set_dport(12345);
```

- **Packet defragmentation/reordering:** In some protocols, packets may be fragmented (such as IPv4) or arrive out-of-order (TCP, SCTP, etc.). `pkts` overcomes both of these issues through `Sequence` types that transparently handle defragmentation and reordering. `Sequence` types can even be stacked so that application-layer data can easily be reassembled from captured packets. They even work in `no-std` environments with or without `alloc`.
- **Stateful packet support:** Many network protocols are stateful, and interpreting packets from such protocols can be difficult (if not impossible) to accomplish unless information about the protocol session is stored. Rscap provides `Session` types that handle these kinds of packets--Sessions ensure that packets are validated based on the current expected state of the protocol. Just like `Sequence`, `Session` types are compatible with `no-std` environments and do not require `alloc`.
